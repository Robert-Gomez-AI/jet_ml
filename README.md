# Key Features

## Enhanced Data Preprocessing

Jet ML extends pandas DataFrame functionality with modern, cyberpunk-styled visualizations and streamlined data analysis capabilities:

- Interactive distribution plots with customizable themes
- Intuitive null value detection and visualization
- Quick statistical insights and column analysis
- Efficient null value treatment with multiple strategies
- Seamless integration with pandas workflows

## Machine Learning Pipeline Management

Organize and scale your ML experiments efficiently:

- Track multiple experiments and hyperparameters with different datasets configurations
- Compare model performance across different configurations
- Visualize training metrics and model behavior
- Export results for further analysis

## Experiment Analysis & Reporting

Generate comprehensive insights from your ML experiments:

- Automated performance metric tracking
- Cross-validation result visualization
- Feature importance analysis
- Model comparison dashboards
- Exportable experiment reports

## Hyperparameters estimation

We build our own hyperparameters estimation systems in order to make more effective

## Unified Framework

Jet ML brings together data preprocessing, machine learning, and experiment tracking in one cohesive framework:

- Consistent API across all components
- Streamlined workflow from data to deployment
- Built-in versioning and reproducibility
- Extensible architecture for custom implementations
